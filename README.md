ABM: Micro–Macro Matching & Sensitivity Analysis

Short description

This repository contains an agent‑based model (ABM) and accompanying sensitivity/visualisation scripts that examine micro–macro linkages in a small‑world matching setting. The code produces aggregated outputs and publication‑quality figures comparing three fertility / matching equations across different neighbourhood and buffering scenarios.

Contents
	•	ABM.R — Full ABM + visualisation script. Builds ideal and buffered small‑world matching scenarios and produces combined figures. Warning: large N (e.g. 100000) can be memory‑ and CPU‑intensive.
	•	Sensitivity analysis.R — Full sensitivity analysis and visualisation. Produces the same aggregated output and alternative figure layouts.
	•	sensitivity_results_equations.rds — Example RDS output (generated by the scripts).
	•	sensitivity_agg_equations.csv — Aggregated CSV output (generated by the scripts).
	•	combined_three_equations_titles.png — Example figure produced by the scripts.

Requirements
	•	R (>= 4.0 recommended)
	•	R packages: igraph, ggplot2, viridis, dplyr, tidyr, patchwork (install with install.packages())
